<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my portfolio website.</h3>

<p>This is my portfolio page that features work that I have completed myself and contributed to. I am hardworking and am fun to be around. I am still learning how to work on a team more effectively, but that is the growth process. We learn and apply what we learn to show growth and improvement.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>I have worked on a few different projects and programs. One program I have worked on is a game collection application that lets the user enter game data to store to an SQL database. In a programming class I took the same idea and converted it into a <a href="https://github.com/lozodd29/JSPGameLibrary.git">Java Server Page project</a>. Another project I have worked on is a website for a class project. I will soon be including a link to that site so you can take a look at it. I have been a part of a few group projects as well in some of my classes and the most recent one included work on a service oriented JSP for the CIS department at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania. Also in that group I helped design a recruitment poster that is currently going through approval for public release in a high school. I have the first draft <a>here</a>. One project I am looking to do in the future is to recreate a chess game using Java for the game logic and JavaFX as a GUI for the player.</p>
